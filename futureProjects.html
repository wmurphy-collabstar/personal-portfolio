                        <p>Personally, I have a hard time relaxing, as I'm constantly 
                            moving from one task to another. There are many relaxing 
                            tools out there, so I thought it would be great to have one
                            place on the internet where the point is to pause, be calm,
                            and really try to relax.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The plan is to have a calm moving
                            visual in the background, calming chime notifications, 
                            postiive quotes, stories being read out loud...

                        <p>I adopted a black cat two years ago, and her name is Raven.
                            She is a lovely cat, but also a lot of responsibility. Since
                            she is my first cat, I scrambled around all over the internet
                            trying to find solution after solution for each problem I faced.
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So the Cat Guide 101 will be a one-stop-shop for all things cat
                            related, including food, litter box, exercise, health,
                            and more.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Map of Memories</h3>
                        <p>I have a lot of photos from different parts of my life, and times
                            that I don't want to forget, but it is hard sifting through hundreds
                            upon thousands of pictures and often I completely forget about them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That is why I thought of memory mapping, where you write a sentence or two
                            about a time you remember, and then can add photos for that topic. Each 
                            one of those topics would be connected in a graph style and then you can share
                            your own map with friends and family, or others to help introduce you a bit.

                        <h3>Artistic Dreams</h3>
                        <p>Like many people, I have many different lists of songs, artists, movies, books, etc.
                            that I'm interested in and like to learn more about. For me it's very easy to make too many
                            lists and forget what I wanted to look into.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's why I would make a to-do list
                            but of art you have never seen. And then to entice you to look into it, the
                            website would play a preview of each item, like a snippet of a song,
                            or the first page of a book, to entice you.

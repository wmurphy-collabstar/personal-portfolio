                    <p>The original assignment from freeCodeCamp was to make a technical page,
                        but I took my own spin on the assignment and used the technical page format
                        to create a page about Knitting. That is why the code snippets are there, which 
                        I used to make abstract equations for knitting. My main focus for this project was
                        design and responsiveness, so this website can work on mobile, computer, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>I used CSS for my design and emphasized responsiveness using media queries, and relative units.
                        I also focused on making the background image crisp and at the right position.
                    </p>
                    <p>The main obstacle I had was figuring out positioning of elements as the screen size changed,
                        but with some help from Scrimba UI design courses and searching for media query tips, 
                        I was able to overcome the obstacle.
                    </p>
                    <p>I would like to add more interactivity in the website, as right now it is a single static page.
                        I would include links to other knitting videos and tutorials, maybe create a form that keeps in mind
                        each component of knitting, and from that generate a kind of project to do based on user's knitting experience
                        and what skills they want to use.

                    <p>This project was a test inside my company to see where I was with my skills.
                        Over a month, I built the most functionality than I did for the rest of my projects.
                        The Pokedex is there to share information about all pokemon, including height and weight,
                        type, sound, etc. There's also some functionality to make a favorite pokemon list as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>I built the project using ReactJS, and NextJS. I used NextJS mainly to help
                        with building the website on a local server on my computer, but I learned a lot
                        about React and Next functionality over the process. I used useState and useEffect to update
                        state of components and to make conditional API calls, respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>The main obstacle I had was with the heart icon's functionality. I googled
                        as much as I could, and tried many different methods, but I wasn't able to complete
                        the full functionality of the hearts. It works on the main page, but doesn't update on the 
                        favorites page or the specific pokemon pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>I would like to add the ability to share favorited pokemon lists with friends and family with a 
                        share button, and also have pokemon theme music playing in the background while on the page.

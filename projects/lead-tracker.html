                    <p>The purpose of the Lead Tracker is to keep track of links needed for any
                        purpose, including clients, topics, etc. That is why it uses LocalStorage to 
                        save each link and/or tab when needed. That is also why I made it into a Chrome
                        Extension, so it can be used as a tool while using Chrome.
                    </p>
                    <p>I used Javascript, HTML and CSS in order to build it. I used event listeners
                        to keep track of interactivity with the extension, and used HTML and CSS to 
                        design it the way it looks now.
                    </p>
                    <p>I think the most difficult parts of the project were using LocalStorage and turning the tool 
                        into a Chrome Extension, but with the help of some google searching and Scrimba, I was able to
                        learn how to accomplish each obstacle.
                    </p>
                    <p>In terms of new features, I think it would be helpful to add the date for each link added,
                        and maybe also branch out to have more categories, so you can add links for different kinds 
                        of projects or users. That way the links can be organized and have more data than just the link.

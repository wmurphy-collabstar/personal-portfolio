                    <p>For this project I was also focusing on design, so there is no interactivity.
                        The homepage is to show a vacation spot I like and what I like about it, almost like 
                        I'm a tour guide for the place.
                    </p>
                    <p>I used HTML and CSS to build this site, focusing mainly on the design, using
                        flexbox and other techniques to display the content the way it is.
                    </p>
                    <p>When I worked on this project, I didn't have much experience with design and flexbox, so 
                        the main obstacles were working on those two aspects. With a Figma design and help from Scrimba,
                        I was able to acheive my final goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>I would like to add more interactivity in the page, and have separate pages for 
                        different parts of cape may. I'd also like to link contact info for touring agencies and
                        events happening all year round.
